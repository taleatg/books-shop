This is a solution to the [BookShop task](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/js-fe-course-en/blob/main/tasks/books-shop/books-shop.md) from the RS School course ([JS/Frontend development course (en)](https://rs.school/js-en/)).

## Task
The books shop owner asked you to create the online shop to buy book with delivery to user's home. He wants the user to be able to look through the books' catalog, see the description of a particular book, add a book to the bag, choose the appropriate date and address to deliver.
